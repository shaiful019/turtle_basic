# Python Turtle Graphics Pattern

A simple Python program that creates a geometric pattern using the Turtle graphics library.

## Description

This project uses Python's built-in `turtle` module to draw a geometric pattern. The turtle moves in a specific path to create an interesting design by combining straight lines and turns.

## Features

- Creates a pattern using forward movements and turns
- Uses turtle graphics for visualization
- Maximum speed setting for instant drawing

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional packages required (uses built-in `turtle` module)

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system
2. Clone this repository or download `shaiful.py`
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python shaiful.py
   ```

## Pattern Description

The program draws the following pattern:
